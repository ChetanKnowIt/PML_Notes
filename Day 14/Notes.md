### TOPICS:
1. word embedding algorithms
	* meaning of words
	* chatgpt is application of word embedding algorithms
	* based on rnn
		- word is hot encoded
		- grammar is an obstacle when compared to time series data
2. gensim library
	* two models
		- cbow(continuous bag of words)
		- skip-grams 	
3. word2vec library
	* functions
